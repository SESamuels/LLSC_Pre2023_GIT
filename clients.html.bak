           <div><p  class="pright"> &#8220;We  had a long-standing relationship with LLS Consulting.  Over the years, Lynn provided recruiting, search, interim HR Management, project guidance, coaching and organizational development services for us.  Her most significant contribution was in the area of organizational effectiveness. </p>
          <p class="pright"> Upon her recommendations, we made significant, successful executive and organizational structural changes that helped us become part of a multi-billion dollar global company. Lynn's ability to think strategically, to tie initiatives to business goals, and to develop effective relationships are among her greatest strengths.&#8221; </p>

          <div class="llsc_grey">
            <p class="pleft"> &#8220;LLS Consulting was initially brought in to focus on executive coaching for a member of our team.  It quickly became evident that the issues extended beyond this individual to a significant portion of the department. Lynn met our sense of urgency and conducted a needs assessment that revealed a number of factors on several levels of which we were unaware. </p>
          <p class="pleft"> Her approachable style allowed her to gain information and feedback that was otherwise hidden. The recommendations she made were logical and practical.  She coached two valued leaders, and the results were positive, visible, and sustained. Her work  allowed us to fully realize the potential of these leaders and to gain appreciation on our investment in their talent.&#8221; </p>

          <div>
            <p class="pright"> &#8220;LLS Consulting was identified to address team building issues within our senior management ranks.  Lynn was selected for the project because of her approachable style and communication effectiveness. The results of her team assessment were quite comprehensive and revealing. </p>
          <p class="pright"> Lynn advised us and led us through a process which allowed the team, for the first time, to identify existing realities, experience conflict constructively, gain clarity in purpose, and communicate more effectively. Her ability to read individuals and situations, and to coach accordingly, has been valuable to us. Positive results of our team building efforts, led by Lynn, were visible in our two-day strategic planning session.&#8221; </p>
